                    <br>Rain fizzes down onto the hard ground, crashing like lead onto the heads of the shivering men crouched just inside the deep groove cut into the sodden ground. Most lack helmets and many with gaping ugly wounds are struggling with the cold. Not far away, a streak of lightening rents the sky. Thunder's drums roll steadily on in the background.<br><br>

                    The men are tired, exhausted in fact. Many are drooping like unwatered plants as the clutches of sleep grow ever stronger on them. Several are already lying in the thick layer of cold mud at the bottom of the trench, too tired to care where they fall. To the left there is a gaping hole in the trench wall, where a shell has ripped the earth clean away. The muddy water is stained red in places; red with human blood. A rifle lies nearby, seemingly twisted into a knot by some powerful being in a fit of anger.<br><br>
 
                    Still the men hold their positions, gazing with tired eyes across the barren landscape. Little can be made out through the rain, except a few stunted trees.<br><br>
 
                    A radio transmitter suddenly crackles into life inside the trench, loud even with the hammering of the rain. The men are aroused, and one reaches for the transmitter and flicks the switch.<br><br>

                    “*radio static*....zz...retrea....zz...etrea...zzz...enem..eave....rythin.......else...behin…..retre…..*line ends*”<br><br>

                    Even through the heavy static, a few things stand stark clear. One, the voice was unmistakably the general’s, one of those men who got most of the glory and yet simply spent time sitting in an AC room somewhere safe and distant. Caymans, perhaps. Two, the voice was panic stricken, worried and filled with anxiety and fear to the brim. Something very unusual about the calm general.<br><br>

                    But it really made no sense. Retreating meant surrendering to the enemy. Something they would not do even if it meant death. Something the general knew they would not do even if it meant death. But even if they did put their honor, pride and patriotism aside and did retreat, that too meant death. Behind were the mountains, and given the state of the men, they couldn’t have climbed an inch. Upon that, it was December. Nature was doing its routine work, ignorant that its children had just broken her world. Or she probably didn’t care. She could always heal it.<br><br>

                    So it’s obvious the men will rather die trying to overcome the enemy, with honor, rather than dying as cowards running. Why then, did the general give such a contemptible order? It made no sense. Something was wrong, something these men had no idea of, something that only I knew….<br><br>

                    Blinding light. A crack in the sky.  Boom. Nature’s rage. More rain. Znooo.  A warplane approaching. Chaos. The enemy is coming. A weak voice filled with vigor, “Fall back! Take positions!” Spew spew spew. Plasma everywhere. Screams. Fear. Panic. Friends and foe vanishing. Thin air turning heavy with subatomic particles, turning red with some vaporized liquid. Blood, perhaps. Something red sprays out of their body, and most of those who don’t vanish simply fall back dead, a look of horror and a prayer of mercy on their face. Machine guns, perhaps.  And then, out of nowhere, a pale, thin, cold, green mist approaches. Poison, perha….?<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="star">***<br><br></p>
                    <p>
                    I wake up in a dark, cold room. Slowly, my eyes adjust. I feel nauseated, and I try throwing up. Nothing comes out. Just some blood. My chest aches, and I try putting my hand over there. But my hands are tied to the wall. Then I become aware of the eyes staring at me. Cold, black, expressionless eyes. I summon the courage, and a few garbled words come out. I want to ask “Where are the others?” but I don’t know what exactly comes out. Black eyes walk out. White shirts walk in.<br><br>

                    “Hello, Gabriele. I am a doctor. Harmless and friendly,” he says with a smile. My mind is not in a state to judge whether the smile is fake or true. “You have been asleep for two days since the gas attack. We collected as many of your colleagues as we could. We asked them a few harmless questions, and most of them refused to co-operate. They are sleeping right now, and we have made sure they never wake up,” he then looks at black eyes, who has returned, and points at my wrists. Black eyes unties me. “We are aware that you got orders to retreat, but we came before that could be possible. We are also aware of the reason behind the order. I hope you are too?” I become aware that I am supposed to know something. And then it hits me. “Yes,” I manage to say. I am immediately overcome with guilt. I just betrayed my country. But then, sooner or later I would have had to say it. I was human, after all. I would have broken. Or probably one my colleagues already did. <br><br>

                    The man’s expression immediately changes.<br><br>
                    “Will you please tell me in detail about it? I hope you can speak?”<br><br>
                    I stutter, cough, sneeze out blood, vomit once, and do many such things throughout. But I tell him.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="star">***<br><br></p>
                    <p>
                    Throughout the time I am telling him about it, from studying his expressions one thing is clear. I am the first one telling him. My assumption earlier was wrong. None of my colleagues had spoken yet. So I am indeed a coward traitor.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="star">***<br><br></p>
                    <p>
                    “I didn’t yet tell you what the stone really is, did I Albert?” I ask him.<br><br>
                    “No, you didn’t,” He replies.<br><br>
                    “Let me, then…<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="star">***<br><br></p>
                    <p>
                    “Yes, I can tell you all about it. But why should I?” I ask him.<br><br>
                    “Because if you do, you get to keep your life,” I don’t understand why the sent a doctor to do this. Could have sent an executioner, and saved this shame on the medical profession. <br><br>
                    “May I have some food before that?” saying that I realize my hunger and thirst, remembering that I haven’t eaten since two days.
                    The ‘doctor’ looks at black eyes. He disappears behind the door. <br><br>
                    “I realize that the moment I tell you about the stone, I become a traitor, a criminal in my country who if caught gets death,” I tell him, “What about that?” <br><br>
                    “Well, if you tell us about it, your country - Prague - will cease to exist.”<br><br>
                    “What if I tell you nothing?”<br><br>
                    “That option is highly recommended in case you miss your colleagues, and want to join them where they are.” Now I am sure he is <i>definitely</i> not a doctor. He is the devil himself. “So will you tell us or not?”<br><br>
                    “I reckon I must.”<br><br>
                    “I’m all ears.”<br><br>
                    “So you want to know what’s so special about the stone. Right?”<br><br>
                    “Yes.”<br><br>
                    “Gives off intense heat at a crazy rate in the presence of water, or even the moisture in the air, though in a controllable manner. Enough to turn iron into semi charged sub atomic particles. Problem is, when the water runs out – turns into sub atomic particles – it produces an uncontrollable explosion similar to that produced by a nuke. Everything within a sphere with a 10 miles radius ceases to exist.”<br><br>
                    He gives a low whistle and raises both his eyebrows. “So why did nothing happen in our lab? Everyone’s supposed to be dead by now.”<br><br>
                    “It’s covered in a thick layer of anadium-septic-fluoride or something like tha….”<br><br>
                    “Anovidialerium septa fluoride. Most inert thing on earth.”<br><br>
                    “So what are you going to do with it?”<br><br>
                    “You do realize that this stone can be used as a complete renewable source of energy.”<br><br>
                    “Don’t tell me you started a world war for energy.”<br><br>
                    “I guess they will make bombs, or something. I don’t know.” So the ‘doctor’ isn’t someone with high authority or power.
                    The food comes in, along with black eyes. It’s a loaf of bread and some cheese.<br><br>
                    “Ok, I think we now know a good deal. I appreciate your co-operation, and promise you won’t regret yet. And if you need anything, just ask.” He smiles and gets out of the room. Black eyes gets out with him. <br><br>
                    While they are out, I quickly examine the room. I am facing the door. There’s a ventilation grill towards the top of the wall, left of the door. The door is locked by a keypad system, which needs a password to open. I consider trying to know the password next time black eyes comes in or moves out. But black eyes will probably guard it from my view by blocking it with his body when he enters the password.  The ventilation grill seems to be screwed tightly. I would need a screw driver or something. A knife should do too. But how do I get a knife? It seems very normal for a person who hasn’t had a drop of water to ask for a knife to cut a loaf of bread. Very normal.<br><br>

                    There’s a bed on my right. I notice it is made of wood, and a thin, small chip of wood has come out. It’s sharp, and thin enough to be used as a knife.<br><br>

                    After finishing the food, I notice black eyes still hasn’t returned. He’s outside, perhaps. So I take the food plate and knock on the door. <br><br>

                    “Is anyone there?” I shout. A new guard, with a thin chin, broad neck and fat cheeks stares at me. I notice this one has black eyes too. When I raise my hand holding the plate, he takes it and disappears. So from now on a guard will be waiting outside. Good. <br><br>

                    I try to lift the chair I was sitting on. It’s heavy. Probably it’s me. I become pretty weak since the war broke out.<br><br>

                    Nonetheless I lift it, and carry it to beneath the ventilation fan. I take the small wooden chip, and get up on the chair. I unscrew the ventilation fan out of the wall. I discover it wasn’t screwed in tightly at all, and the job was easy.  I get down and put the grill on the bed. I get back up, and then I look down the hole left by the grill on the wall.<br><br>

                    I am 3 floors above ground. I can’t see any windowsills. <br><br>

                    What now?<br><br>

                    I screw back the grill, and lie down on my bed. My tiredness drags me into a world which stands in stark contrast to the reality.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="star">***<br><br></p>
                    <p>
                    When I wake up, I find a stranger sitting on the chair. Thin like a stick, face unshaved. Tall and lean. No muscles. None that’s visible, anyway.<br><br>

                    “Who are you?” I ask, my voice betraying my overflowing shock and fear.<br><br>
                    “My name is Albert.” He timidly replies.<br><br>
                    “Now who is that?” <br><br>
                    “I was in division 105. They attacked, and I got here. There’s seems to be no space. That’s why we are sharing rooms.”<br><br>
                     “Have they interrogated you yet?” I ask<br><br>
                    “Yes”<br><br>
                    “What did you say?”<br><br>
                    “They didn’t ask much. Just the names of others in the division, whether I knew anything about something called the ‘stone’…”
                    I don’t know why, but I panic. Then I remember my betrayal.<br><br>
                    “What did you say?”<br><br>
                    “I said I know nothing. They seemed to believe me. They asked a few other minor questions, and then put me here.” He says, “What about you?”<br><br>

                    I tell him.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="star">***<br><br></p>
                    <p>
                    “What might they do with the stone?” Albert asks.<br><br>

                    Albert’s division seemed to have yielded last, among Prague’s once mighty army. Prague, with its gigantic tanks, world demolishing fleet of nukes, submarines and ships larger than the human mind can imagine, storm causing fleet or warplanes, with its proud leaders and happy, satisfied citizens, finally on its knees.<br><br>

                    Albert tells me from what he knew that Prague was going to fire all its remaining nukes at all the nations which are part of The United Alliance – which Gelenovikia is part of. That’s where they were held right now. Currently, they were somewhere in Gelenovikia’s top secret military head quarters. Albert says Prague had somehow got to know its location, and planned on nuking it.<br><br>

                    “They will probably not use it, not for physical purposes at least, no. It’s just to instill fear in the people, and to use that fear for the benefit of the politicians. Or they will make something worse that nukes. They might discover more of these strange mineral. All this, of course, if anything remains of this world.” I smile, looking at him. “You know, Einstein once said that he didn’t know what World War 3 would be fought with, but he knew that World War 4 would be fought with sticks and stones. I reckon we are about to prove him right. And….”<br><br>

                    I am gazing out of the gaps in the ventilator grill. It’s a starless night outside, dark, the time when beings sleep, a time when we assume we will be safe, that we will be living tomorrow. Silhouetted against the dark sky, I see something bright appear. I stop talking, and point towards the ventilator, gesturing Albert to look at it. He looks at it, looks back at me, an expression of confusion on his face, a reflection of my own. The bright thing gets bigger. That’s when we realize. The next thing we know is oblivion. <br><br>
